# Building a sign language recognition model using the Resnet-50 network
# Introduction
This project creates a model using the ResNet-50 architecture to recognize Vietnamese sign language, including 22 unaccented letters.
# Features
 Trained ResNet-50 model for sign language classification using TensorFlow.
 Processed real-time image frames from webcam input using OpenCV.
 Used MediaPipe library for hand detection and cropped hand images to feed into prediction model.
 Integrated entire pipeline for real-time sign language recognition and prediction.
